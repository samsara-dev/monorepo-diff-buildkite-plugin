- A maintainer will merge and create a release (see [Releasing](https://github.com/samsara-dev/monorepo-diff-buildkite-plugin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#releasing)).

## Testing

All changes must be unit tested and meet the project test coverage threshold (73%) requirement.
Run `make test` to run all tests and generate coverage reports before submitting a pull request.

To write the `bats` tests for plugin,
1. Modify the tests
2. Run `docker-compose build plugin_test && docker-compose run --rm plugin_test`

## Formatting

All code must be formatted with `gofmt` (with the latest Go version) and pass `go vet`. The plugin must be linted with [buildkite-plugin-linter](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/buildkite-plugin-linter). Run `make quality` to run all formatting checks.

## Releasing

One of the maintainers will create a release after merging the pull request.
- Ensure documentation is updated appropriately.
- Update all occurrences of plugin version in [README.md]( https://github.com/samsara-dev/monorepo-diff-buildkite-plugin/blob/master/README.md ).
- create and push the next tag version
- Github actions will automatically create the release.
